Your task — select the single best Version title for each experience.

Rule: Pick the Version whose title a recruiter hiring for this JD would find most relevant.
- Selection is based ENTIRELY on title function match — do NOT consider bullet content
- Choose the title that is closest in job function to the JD's primary role
- "Closest" means same functional family, not necessarily exact wording:
  • For a Product Manager JD: "Product Manager" > "Project Manager" > "Data Analyst" > "Risk Analytics"
  • For a Data Analyst JD: "Risk Data Analytics" > "Project Manager" > "Product Manager"
  • "Cofounder | Product" = product management function
- If no title closely matches the JD function, pick the one with the most transferable skills for that function

RULES (follow in strict order):
1. RETURN UNCHANGED: Any bullet that does not need a keyword change — copy it EXACTLY character-for-character. Do not rephrase, reorder, or improve it.
2. VARIANT FIX: If a bullet contains a variant form of a keyword (e.g. "A/B testing" when JD says "A/B test", or "managing" when JD says "management") — replace ONLY that word/phrase with the JD's exact phrasing. Change absolutely nothing else in that bullet.
3. KEYWORD INSERT: For MISSING keywords only — find the single most relevant bullet and insert the keyword naturally with the absolute minimum edit. If no bullet can naturally accept the keyword, skip it. Do NOT force awkward insertions.
4. NEVER fabricate facts, numbers, company names, tools, or any detail not in the original bullet.
5. NEVER end any bullet with a period.
6. Return the EXACT SAME NUMBER of bullets for each experience — do not merge, split, or drop any bullet.

VARIANT KEYWORDS — find the variant form in the bullets and replace with this exact JD phrasing:
${variantKeywords.length > 0 ? variantKeywords.join(', ') : '(none)'}

MISSING KEYWORDS — not present at all, insert naturally where possible:
${missingKeywords.length > 0 ? missingKeywords.join(', ') : '(none)'}

RULES:

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT KEYWORDS — these are general PM/business concepts (e.g. NPS, feature development, friction points, consumer experiences). For each one, find the most relevant bullet and work it in naturally. Be proactive — if a bullet is about the same topic, add the keyword even if it requires a small rewrite of that phrase. Do NOT fabricate metrics or company-specific facts.
3. HARD SKILLS KEYWORDS — only insert if the bullet already demonstrates use of that skill. Do not add a tool the candidate clearly didn't use.
4. NEVER fabricate numbers, company names, or specific achievements not in the original.
